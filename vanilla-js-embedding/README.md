# Vanilla JS Embedding Sample

## Coming Soon

This sample will demonstrate how to embed the EmbedMetrics chat widget in a plain HTML/JavaScript application without any framework dependencies.

### Planned Features

- Minimal JavaScript implementation
- Direct token fetching from backend
- Framework-free integration
- Same security patterns as React sample

### Status

This sample is currently in development. Check back soon!

In the meantime, you can use the [React embedding sample](../react-embedding/) which demonstrates the same integration patterns.
